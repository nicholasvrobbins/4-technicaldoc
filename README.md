This is the 4th project in the freeCodeCamp HTML & CSS Project section. I learned more about CSS Grid layout, using grid-gap to move over divs and objects, learned about using the <code> element in HTML and block styling it in CSS. This was a more basic, but still very fun project that I learned plenty from!
